I'd like to briefly introduce myself. My name is Stefanie Caffarel but I go by Stefie or Stef. My pronouns are she/her. I am a yoga and indoor rock climbing instructor by passion, a 'super taster' as my niece used to call me, a lover of awkward silences, deep dives, nerd alert exchanges my doggie Duma, and long run-on sentences. You'll find me in a comfy chair with my lap desk and a steamy coffee, riding my bike with my buddies, cooking something saucy, or perhaps sitting in silence. Does any of that sound too good to be true? Does Expensify 'sound to good to be true?' Yeah, it surely does! Reading through the Expensify website, I felt that I have found my place. For the last eight months, I have been enrolled in a fully remote Full Stack Web Development course. That said, I don't just want to land a job in tech. I want to be by your side, saving the world! Thank you for your time consideration and energy, I know I am green. I will do everything in my power not to disappoint you! </p> <p class="content paper-content"> <b class="question">1.

And I want to build my own. Phase one is in full swing: purpose, planning, and information gathering. I am aiming to begin phase two next month.

What's your coding history? When did you start, and what have you done between then and now?</b> </p> <p class="content paper-content">It was a warm and brightening Tuesday two years ago. I wanted to do what I was doing but bigger and better. I wanted to offer more; hold more space for my community. I needed a career that would support big growth. I had been interested in the tech industry since a bestie had done a bootcamp ten years ago, but was studying yoga, and climbing instead. When I spoke with friends who were either studying to be or were tech professionals I got even more excited. This was it. I bought a refurbished mac lap top with my tax return. I started practicing. Several learn to code apps joined my app library, I found Swift Playgrounds which turned out to be my favorite, and of course freecodecamp.org. I spent 1-3 hours a day trying to "uncode" the code. It continued to stick, so I made a plan. </p><p class="content paper-content"> Spending some time in contemplation, I qualified some things. I have always loved to build what others see and interact with directly. I get down on intricate but subtle detail. I often choose my phone more over my computer. I leaned toward mobile app development, the visually creative side of UX, and the small yet oh so significant details of UI. Again, I found wanted more. I wanted to go a level deeper, underneath those principals to what I saw as how a coder communicates those principals within the bigger system. Fullstack stack seemed like it would hit all the bullets. I want to nerd out on the fine details and set everything in place. </p> <p class="content paper-content"> For me a coding bootcamp or a private tech program was the way to go. In June 2022, GoIt showed up in my instagram feed. The program was extensive, it was affordable, and they showed up. August 2022, my formal learning journey began. I spent the first four months working and studying. It became clear that I wanted to spend more time and give more focus to my studies. I wanted to learn, and I wanted results fast. I asked for help, and received some financial support from a family member. I took time off work and put more hours into my course. Taking one more step I packed my truck and left my home in Tucson, Az. My pup and I journeyed up to Washington State where my brother and sister-in-law live. Taking some constructive space from the other parts of my life greatly aided my focus. The quality time with my brother and sister-in-law further supported my growth. Here we are, all caught up. I am practicing React.js, looking ahead to Node.Js and the completion of my course in a couple months. </p> <p></p> <p class="content paper-content"> <b class="question">6. What do you want to do with the rest of your life, and how is Expensify a step toward your long-term goals?</b> </p><p class="content paper-content">My goal in life is to live learn and grow in the vein of adding as much love and support to the growth of as many other lives as possible in whatever way being myself allows. Up until now I have achieved this in a small capacity in my local community. I would like to do more. Expensify's Philosophy says it all. Live Rich, Have Fun, and Save the World! Ya'll nailed it! </p> <p></p> <p class="content paper-content">What this looks like in my community right away: My first big goal is to restore my beautiful 100 + year old adobe. My design and implementation are based on preserving the beauty of local architecture with a focus on sustainability, permaculture, and the local ecosystem of the Sonoran Desert. My vision is to turn Adobe House into a part time residence, most times Artist Residency. I want to provide a beautiful oasis for artists of all expressions to find. A place to build a body of work. I want to hold that space. Moving beyond Adobe House I will work tirelessly to bring water harvesting and other principals of zeroscape permaculture to my entire neighborhood. Trees need to be planted, curbs need to be cut, and buffel grass needs to be pulled! The empty lot with all the dead cars next door will be a walk-in garden with local and edible landscape. On a day to day basis, my goals are to further inform my Hatha yoga teaching and offer classes that are sliding scale based- no one is turned away for lack of funds. I want to add a scholarship program for BellaRock and BellaLead, two women's indoor climbing classes that I teach at my local gym. I want to invest in the sustainable building projects in Southern Arizona my friends and local contractors of Awareness Ranch are building. Ha! That is just the beginning, I will write your fingers off by text or talk your ear off over a coffee or a mezcal, anytime! </p> <p class="content paper-content"> <b class="question">7.
