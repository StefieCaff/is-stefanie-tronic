My name is Stefanie Caffarel and my pronouns are she/her. I like to be called Stef or Stefie. Reading through the Who We Are and Hiring Process of your website, I knew that I had found my place. Until recently I have been merely a consumer and lover of "tech". The newest chapter of my story is changing that. For the last eight months, I have been enrolled in a fully Remote Full Stack Web Development course. Check out the <a href="https://goit.global/us/courses/fullstack" class="goit-link">GoIT homepage</a>. It is about time to add the professional coder chapter to my story as I continue to be a creator of experience and a practitioner of life with this beautiful world that we share! </p> <p class="content paper-content"> <b class="question">1. What's the URL of your website? If you don't have one, why not?</b></p> <p class="content paper-content">To be succinct, in the past I didn't see a need for one. Now, I do! And I want to build my own. Phase one is in full swing: purpose, planning, and information gathering. I am aiming to begin phase two next month. For my wire-frame I will explore Figma's free online platform to give shape to my ideas. </p> <p class="content date paper-content"> All of my current repositories can be found at: <a href="https://github.com/StefieCaff">Stefie's GITHUB</a>. In question two I will do my best to showcase my work as I guide you through some of the more complex/ integrated assignments and projects I have from my course. </p> <p class="content paper-content"> I once had a MySpace yes, I am that ...young. It is now defunct. There is my good ol' Tumblr blog from 2013 <a>Xhouzhouzhou.tumbler.com</a> (Xhouzhouzhou is my interpretation of the magnificent sound of bike tires whizzing along a quiet back road). It is a bunch of silliness from my first big bike tour. Unrelated to coding--- but a glimpse of me and my long run on sentences. </p> <p class="content paper-content"> <b class="question">2.

What's your coding history? When did you start, and what have you done between then and now?</b> </p> <p class="content paper-content">It was a warm and brightening Tuesday two years ago. I decided that joining the tech industry was my new goal. I bought a refurbished mac lap top with my tax return. I hopped on Google and spent a month or so reading about AI, UX vs UI, data analysis, frontend vs backend, mobile vs web, cyber security and the opinions of my peers in the industry. I decided to just start doing it. I downloaded several learn to code apps on my phone, found Swift Playgrounds which turned out to be my favorite, and of course freecodecamp.org. I spent 1-3 hours a day trying to "uncode" the code. When it stuck, decided I needed a plan. First, where to focus, next what the future might hold, third who can help, and finally HOW to actually do it. I have always loved to build what others see and interact with directly. I get down on intricate but subtle detail. I have often chosen my phone more over my computer. So I leaned toward mobile app development. The fullstack option seemed best for the long term. I also felt that if, in the future, I wanted to switch to UX or UI, my experience gained here would add an indelible signature. For me a coding bootcamp or a private tech program was the way to go, so I started scouring the web. It actually took me a while to decided but in May 2022, I finally found one that I was excited about, could afford, and that showed up for me from the moment I joined the intro webinar. A month later we signed our contract and in August 2022 my formal learning journey began. I spent the first four months working and studying. So that I could take the next 6 months off "work" to focus on my studies, I borrowed money from a family member, packed my truck and left my home in Tucson, Az. My pup and I journeyed up to Washington State. Because my program is remote I am wanted to take this time to spend quality time with my brother and sister-in-law while I study. Now we are caught up. My program ends in a couple months. I want to get a job in tech and keep the momentum going. </p> <p class="content paper-content"> <b>4. What do you want to do with the rest of your life, and how is Expensify a step toward your long-term goals?</b> My goal in life is to live learn and grow in the vein of adding as much love and support for the growth of as many other lives as possible in whatever way being myself allows. I have been able to do this in a small capacity, but would like to do more. Expensify's Philosophy says it all for me. Live Rich, Have Fun, and Save the World! Nailed it! </p> <p class="content paper-content">What that looks like for me right off the bat: My first big goal is to restore the beautiful 100 + year old adobe that I purchased 3 years ago. It has slowly been degrading into its current state of disrepair since it was sold in the 50's. My design and implementation are based on sustainability, permaculture, and the local ecosystem of the Sonoran Desert. My vision is to turn Adobe House into a part time residence part time Artist Residency. I want it to be a beautiful oasis for artists to find. A place to build a body of work. I want to hold that space. Moving beyond the house. I will work tirelessly to bring water harvesting and other principals of zeroscape permaculture to my entire neighborhood. Trees need to be planted, curbs need to be cut, and buffel grass needs to be pulled! The empty lot with all the dead cars next door could be a walk-in garden with local and edible landscape. On a day to day basis, my goals are to further inform my Hatha yoga teaching and offer classes that are sliding scale based- no one is turned away for lack of funds. I want to add a scholarship program for BellaRock and BellaLead, two women's indoor climbing classes that I teach at my local gym. After that I would love to work with my local butcher to start a raw meaty bones dog food branch that would support local animal shelters. Ha! The list goes on, I will write your fingers off or talk your ear off over a coffee or a mezcal, anytime! </p> <p class="content paper-content"> <b class="question">5. How did you hear about us?</b> This one is easy.
